# The game files
In the future, I'll probably be using a different file structure, but I broke my first project down as follows:
- Assets: contains subfolders for sound and art respectively
- Addons: a folder for plugins
- Scenes: contains a variety of subfolders breaking scenes down into types (for example characters or fullscreen)
- Scripts: a general directory containing most of my global 'singleton' scripts
