# The game files
> This will be updated over time to reflect changes made
## Assets
Broken down into **audio (FX and music) and art (characters, fonts, objects, static, ui)**

## Addons
Github integration, which allows connection to the github repository so changes can constantly be pulled (when you want to work on the project) and merged (when you're done working).

## Scenes
The scenes in our game

## Themes (found under UI)
Extremely useful precreated templates for decorated and automated nodes (might help us reduce a lot of animation and asset work)
