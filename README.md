# Medical Bill$
## By Xanmankey (and credits to Bananaman1_1 for helping me come up w/ the idea)
This is my entry for the summer rendition of My First Game Jam (quite literally my first game jam; and my first game). I learned a lot from this project (as seen by the 'currently-unorganized' notes file). I'm really proud of the game and what I learned, even though I wasn't able to add all the functionality I wanted to (I was hoping to add scene serialization so I could store scene states, as well as sfx, but I wasn't able to get around to either). Beware those medical bills!

(and no, I understand that there's still bugs and crashes, I will not be patching those out. I've learned what I've wanted to, I think it's time for me to move on to a new project).
